  "Report the PERSISTED half of the EN transfer funnel from a live kotobase.net
  graph -- the auditable half, recomputed from the ledger rather than trusted
  from whatever process emitted the counters.

  Why (com-junkawasaki/root adr-ledger seq 66, 2026-07-25): a system-dynamics
  pass over `kotoba-lang/dynamics`' archetype catalog found
  `:engi-en-mutual-credit-current` at instrumentation-completeness 0 -- the
  lowest in a catalog where every incumbent money system sits at 0.90-0.98 --
  and ranked fixing that ABOVE every currency-design change, because a loop
  nobody measures can only be asserted about. `engi.metrics` gives the funnel
  its shape; this script is what actually points it at real data.

  Usage (nbb, per CLAUDE.md's nbb-only script-host rule):

    ENGI_SECRET_KEY_B64=<base64 ed25519 secret key> \\
      nbb --classpath src:<kotobase-client-src> bin/engi_metrics.cljs [opts]

  opts:
    --endpoint URL        default https://kotobase.net
    --operator-did DID    default did:web:kotobase.net
    --affiliated-did DID  a DID whose key the OPERATOR CONTROLS (repeatable).
                          Required for :external-counterparties to be computed
                          at all -- see the warning below. The DID being read is
                          always affiliated (it is the key you supplied).
    --json                emit JSON instead of EDN

  ── what this can and cannot see, stated up front ──────────────────────────

  It reads exactly ONE graph: the one belonging to the key in
  ENGI_SECRET_KEY_B64. That is not a limitation of this script, it is the
  live constraint `engi.live-test` documented on 2026-07-09 -- kotobase.net's
  apex requires a CACAO on every call and only a graph's own key can mint a
  satisfying one, so an unauthenticated third party gets 401 reading someone
  else's graph. A network-wide funnel therefore needs either per-agent runs
  or a delegated-read CACAO that does not exist yet.

  It reports counter-commits and finalizations only. Proposals, validations
  and rejections leave no trace in any graph by design (protocol steps 1-2
  perform no writes), so they come from `engi.protocol`'s `:on-event` emitter
  or not at all -- and `engi.metrics/counts->response` reports them as
  :unobserved rather than 0 when nobody emitted them. That distinction is the
  whole point; do not read an :unobserved as a zero."
