;; Generates shadow-cljs.edn's :source-paths from `clojure -Spath -A:test` --
;; pulls in every git-dep src dir at the EXACT SHA deps.edn pins, so the cljs
;; build tests against the same versions `clojure -M:test` would (same
;; convention as kotoba-lang/prolly-tree, kotoba-lang/kotobase-peer).
;; shadow-cljs.edn is gitignored -- regenerate before every cljs run, never
;; hand-edit, never commit. (It was committed once anyway, by a cleanup sweep
;; that landed untracked files, and sat there for weeks with a stale ns-regexp
;; and an absolute path out of one machine's ~/.gitlibs.)
;;
;; `-A:test` and not a bare `-Spath`: `engi.chain-test` and `engi.pool-test`
;; drive a real `inga.state` machine, and inga is a TEST-only dependency. With
;; the bare classpath those two namespaces cannot compile on cljs at all,
;; which is how they came to be the only tests in this repo that ran on one
;; runtime.
;;
;; Two build targets, kept in SEPARATE ns-regexps (not separate source dirs
;; -- shadow-cljs :node-test scans the whole classpath regardless) so a
;; plain `npm run test:cljs` can NEVER accidentally reach the live-network
;; test:
;;   :test       engi.core-test / engi.crypto-test / engi.protocol-test /
;;               engi.metrics-test / engi.chain-test / engi.pool-test (the
;;               pure .cljc ones also run on the JVM) / engi.consensus-test /
;;               engi.stake-test (fake in-memory client -- no network, safe
;;               for CI)
;;   :live-test  engi.live-test only (real kotobase.net, throwaway did:key
;;               agents -- deliberately NOT run by CI, see README)
;;
;; `.cjs` output, not `.js`: package.json says `"type": "module"` and
;; shadow-cljs `:node-test` emits CommonJS, so `node out/test.js` fails on the
;; first `require`. Same reason kotoba-lang/inga writes `out/test.cjs`.
;;
;; nbb port of the babashka original (ADR-2607173000, bb binary retired as
;; the fleet task/script host). Standalone -- no dependency on the
;; superproject's scripts/nbb_compat shim.
