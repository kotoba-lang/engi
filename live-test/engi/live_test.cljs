  "LIVE integration test against PRODUCTION kotobase.net (ADR-2607101100 task
  step 3). NOT run by CI (see .github/workflows/ci.yml) — run manually with
  `npm run test:live` / `bb test-live`.

  Mints two FRESH throwaway did:key agents (nothing pre-registered, nothing
  reused across runs — every run gets brand-new keys, so this never
  collides with real user data or a previous run's state) and drives one
  full real propose -> validate -> counter-commit -> finalize cycle against
  the actual server, then re-fetches BOTH parties fresh (new reader clients,
  not reusing any in-process state) and folds — proving the whole write/read
  round trip works against the real backend, not just the in-memory fake
  (`engi.fake-kotobase`) the other tests use.

  Prints the exact HTTP status + body for every step, verbatim, per the task
  spec — this is deliberately noisy stdout, not terse `cljs.test` output,
  because the report needs to show real wire evidence.

  ── real limitation discovered by this test (2026-07-09) ──────────────────
  `engi.store/reader-client` (`:public-reads? true`, no CACAO) gets a bare
  `401 {\"ok\":false,\"error\":\"Unauthorized\"}` from the live kotobase.net
  apex when targeting a graph it doesn't own — the apex requires SOME CACAO
  on every datomic.* call (not just writes), and only the graph's own key
  can mint one that satisfies \"graph scope == issuer DID\". So a THIRD
  PARTY (e.g. the receiver reading the SPENDER's graph for
  `validate-proposal!`, or an independent auditor) cannot read an ordinary
  tenant graph today unless it's separately registered \"Public\"
  server-side (kotobase.client's own docstring alludes to this registration
  existing for the operator's yoro-social db; no such toggle is exposed to
  an ordinary tenant agent as of this test). This test therefore has EACH
  PARTY validate/audit its OWN graph with its OWN owner-client (self-check)
  rather than the cross-agent read the ADR's `validate-proposal!` design
  calls for — `engi.protocol-test` still exercises the FULL cross-agent
  design against the fake client, where this restriction doesn't apply.
  See the README \"Known limitations\" section."
