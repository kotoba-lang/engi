  "Transfer-loop telemetry for ENGI/EN — the funnel that turns \"the EN loop
  has never fired\" from an assertion into a measurement.

  Why this exists (com-junkawasaki/root adr-ledger seq 66, 2026-07-25): a
  system-dynamics pass scored every archetype in `kotoba-lang/dynamics`'
  catalog on the same formula and found `:engi-en-mutual-credit-current`
  carrying `instrumentation-completeness 0` — the LOWEST in a catalog where
  every incumbent money system (Visa 0.95, Ethereum 0.98, commercial bank
  credit creation 0.95) sits at 0.90-0.98. A loop nobody measures cannot be
  diagnosed, only asserted about, and `dynamics.core/loop-structural-strength`
  returns nil rather than a number for exactly that reason. Instrumentation
  ranked ABOVE every currency-design change in that pass (6.30 vs 5.95/5.25)
  because it is the precondition for knowing whether any later change worked.

  This mirrors `kotobase.x402-metrics` (gftdcojp/net-kotobase), which did the
  same job for the agent-payment funnel one day earlier — deliberately the
  same shape (ordered stages, event->stage map, monotonic counters, rates that
  are nil rather than fake-0 when their denominator is 0) so the two funnels
  read alike and a single collector can consume both.

  ── The EN transfer funnel, in protocol order (ADR-2607101100 Decision #2) ──

    proposals       -- a spender built and self-signed a TransferBody
                       (`engi.protocol/propose-transfer!`). Intent. NOTHING is
                       written to any graph at this step.
    validations     -- a receiver independently re-derived the spender's state
                       and every invariant held (`validate-proposal!` =>
                       :valid? true). Acceptance.
    rejections      -- `validate-proposal!` => :valid? false. Friction, and the
                       single most diagnostic stage: :reason tells you WHICH
                       invariant is costing transfers (stale-prev vs
                       credit-limit-exceeded vs bad-signature are entirely
                       different problems with entirely different fixes).
    counter-commits -- the receiver wrote its credit entry to its OWN graph
                       (`counter-commit!`). First durable write.
    finalizations   -- the spender wrote its debit entry (`finalize!` =>
                       :finalized? true). CONVERSION: the transfer now exists
                       bilaterally and nets to zero.

  So `finalizations / proposals` is the transfer completion rate, and
  `rejections / (validations + rejections)` is the validation failure rate.

  ── Two halves, with an honest asymmetry between them ──

  1. EMITTED (this ns's counter half). Steps 1-2 perform no writes, so
     proposals/validations/rejections exist ONLY if something counts them as
     they happen. `engi.protocol` now takes an optional `:on-event` callback
     for exactly this. If nobody passes one, the top of the funnel is simply
     unobserved — and it is reported as unobserved, never as 0.

  2. PERSISTED (`funnel-from-entities`). counter-commits and finalizations
     ARE durable: they are credit and debit entries in the two agents' own
     kotobase graphs. So the BOTTOM of the funnel can be recomputed by anyone
     with read access, from data they did not have to trust the emitter for.
     This is the auditable half, and it is what `bin/engi_metrics.cljs`
     reports against live kotobase.net.

  Keeping the two halves distinguishable is the point: an emitted count is an
  assertion by the process that emitted it, a persisted count is a fact about
  the ledger. Do not merge them into one number.

  Pure `.cljc` — no js interop, no I/O, no wall clock — so the counter shape
  and the response body are unit-testable on every runtime and shared
  byte-for-byte with whatever hosts them, the same discipline `engi.core` and
  `engi.stake` already hold."
