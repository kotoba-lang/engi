  "Transfer state machine (ADR-2607101100 Decision #2): propose -> validate
  -> counter-commit -> finalize, plus `audit-agent!`. Pure orchestration —
  every fn here takes an explicit client (or clients) and returns a Promise;
  all the actual invariant logic lives in `engi.core` (pure) and
  `engi.crypto` (signing), this ns just wires them to `engi.store` I/O so
  the whole handshake can be exercised against a FAKE in-memory client in
  tests (see test/engi/protocol_test.cljs) and the REAL kotobase.net client
  identically (test/engi/live_test.cljs) — no branching on client type
  anywhere in this file.

  `client` here means anything `engi.store`'s `fetch-entities!`/
  `write-entity!` accept — either a real `kotobase.client` client, or (in
  tests) a fake with the same `fetch-entities!`/`write-entity!` shape (a
  plain map of dids -> atom of entities works, see the test fake)."

  (or the spender's own client works too, for tests). `known-validators` —
  optional seq of reader-clients whose graphs may carry already-filed
  warrant entities naming this spender (opt-in registry check on top of the
  direct, always-on fork re-check — see ns docstring / README).

  (unauthenticated `:public-reads?`) gets 401 Unauthorized reading a graph
  it doesn't own — the apex requires a CACAO on every call, and only the
  graph owner's own key can mint a satisfying one. So today a genuine
  cross-agent call (the receiver independently reading the SPENDER's graph)
  only works once the spender's graph is registered \"Public\" server-side,
  or once a delegated-read-CACAO handshake exists (neither is implemented
  here). Until then, `spender-reader-client` in practice has to be the
  spender's OWN owner-client (a weaker, self-attested check) — this fn's
  LOGIC is unaffected either way; only which client can successfully fetch
  changes. `engi.protocol-test` exercises the full cross-agent design
