(ns engi.chain
  "engi's source chain, addressed so that inga can order it.

  Superproject ADR-2608038000 H1 says what inga orders: the ADVANCE of an
  agent chain head, not a transaction. `inga.chain` landed the consensus half
  — a committed proposal becomes an `:actor-advance` and the agent's head
  moves. This namespace is the production half: it addresses an engi entry so
  there is something for a proposal to name.

  ## One link, not two

  engi already chains its entries: `:engi/prev-hash` is the hash of the
  previous entry, and `next-entry` takes it explicitly because \"computing
  the hash of an entry needs a hash-fn\". inga needs `prev` to be the CID of
  the previous entry, because the actor tree stores it in `:state` and that
  field has to stay walkable.

  Those are the same link, so **use `entry-cid` as engi's `hash-fn`**. Then
  `:engi/prev-hash` IS the CID inga reads, `fold-balance`'s continuity check
  and inga's `:forked` check are checking one thing, and there is no second
  chain to keep in agreement with the first.

  Getting this wrong would not have failed loudly: two links over one chain
  agree until they don't, and the disagreement surfaces as a fork nobody
  authored.

  ## What the block is

  The entry itself, as a DAG-CBOR map, minus `:db/id` — an entity id is a
  storage detail and `canonical-entry` already excludes it for the same
  reason. So a generic IPLD walker reaching an actor's `:state` from the
  state root arrives at the ledger entry, with no engi-specific decoder.

  `canonical-entry` remains what is SIGNED. Signing a string and addressing a
  map is not two canonical forms in conflict: they commit to exactly the same
  fields, and `entry-fields` is the one list both read.

  ## Not in this namespace

  Signing (`engi.crypto`), storage (`engi.store`), and whether an entry is
  economically valid (`fold-balance`). An advance says an agent moved its own
  head from here to there; whether it should have is the application's
  question, answered before it votes — `inga.chain`'s docstring draws that
  line and this side does not cross it."
