(ns engi.fake-kotobase
  "An in-memory, no-network double of the kotobase.net XRPC surface
  (`ai.gftd.apps.kotobase.datomic.{datoms,transact}`), injected via
  `kotobase.client/make-client`'s `:fetch-fn` seam — the SAME injection
  point `kotobase-client`'s own test suite uses
  (`kotobase.client-request-test/capturing-fetch` et al) and
  `yoro-ui.studio.genko-store`'s docstring calls out as the reason every fn
  here takes the client map explicitly. This is what makes
  `engi.protocol-test` exercise the REAL `engi.store`/`engi.crypto`/
  `engi.protocol` code paths end to end, with only the HTTP transport
  swapped for an in-memory map — not a separate, parallel mock of
  `engi.protocol`'s own logic.

  Does not verify CACAO (kotobase-client's own test suite already pins that
  wire shape) — it stores/returns datoms exactly like the real server does,
  keyed by graph CID, and parses `tx_edn` well enough for the fixed shape
  `engi.store/entity->tx-edn` produces (one flat entity map, every value
  token whitespace-free — did:key/CID/base64url/base64 alphabets and plain
  numbers never contain a space, so a single `clojure.string/split` on
  whitespace is a faithful, exact tokenizer here — no general EDN reader
  needed)."

  "The tx_edn `entity->tx-edn` produces is `[{:kw1 val1 :kw2 val2 ...}]`,
  ONE entity, every val a single whitespace-free token (a bare number/bool/
  nil literal, or a JSON-quoted string whose content is always an alphabet
  with no spaces — did:key, base32 CID, base64url sig, uuid-suffixed id).
  So splitting on whitespace after stripping the outer `[{`/`}]` recovers
  exactly the k/v token pairs — passed straight through as `v_edn` (the real
  server also stores whatever EDN-string-literal token it was given,
  verbatim; `kotobase.client/decode-edn-scalar` on the READ side is what
  actually interprets it)."
